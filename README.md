This Repo is a code sample for MLH fellowship.

### QuizyAR is a playground book, I created intending to make learning fun, and full of rewards which include an Augmented Reality game, that I would like to present in this yearâ€™s WWDC.
The basic of the game includes a ball, and the player is supposed to move it using an on-screen joystick to score a goal. 

The code was written in swiftplayground and so it might have some supporting files.

Here jump on to main code ::
